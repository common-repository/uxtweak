== Description ==

**How easy-to-use is your website or web-based prototype? Just define tasks for users, send them a study link and see how they're using your web.**

Every tester's interaction is recorded, so you can replay any moment of testing. Testers don’t need special software or browser extensions. UXtweak guides testers as they do tasks directly on your website. Simple 10 min integration.

**Design intuitive navigation menus and site structures, so your web site or app is easy to navigate.**

Let users group your labels (e.g., menu items) into categories that make sense to them. Results show you how to create a usable menu that reflects user expectations. Users will no longer be lost. It’s quick and simple. No installation needed. Just send testers a study link.

**Can users find what they're looking for in your navigation menu? Validate your existing menus and site structures.**

Define tasks for finding something contained in a category of your menu (e.g., finding sales office's opening hours). Introduce the menu to your testers and ask them to solve the tasks. Results show you whether the labels and category hierarchy match user expectations. No installation needed.

**Record and watch how visitors use your web site or app, including what frustrates them.**

UXtweak can capture every interaction a user has with your web and make it searchable. For example, you can replay the journeys of customers who come from Facebook, search for "iPhone" and abandon the shopping cart. Heatmaps, activity tracking and more. Simple 10 min installation in your web.
